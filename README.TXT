the start of lab 2:)

2: It returns to 0

3: There are no refunds, it still prints a ticket even if i do not insert enough money

5: Yes it is different as the price is changed to 50 cents which is what i set it to.

6: public class LabClass, public class Student

7: Yes it does matter, the screen color changes from green to white and the error is that there is no longer a class. The message
I get is "class required" I believe it does not clearly explain the error as the mistake is the order of the "public class".

8: yes it is possible as there is no error

9: no it is not possible as it deletes the class and there multiple errors

10: Fields: "public class TicketMachine"

    Constructors: public TicketMachine(int cost)
    {
        price = cost;
        balance = 0;
        total = 0;
    }
    
    Methods:  public int getPrice()
    {
        return price;
    }

    public int getBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }

11: Constructors do not have a return feature and constructors have empty brackets

12: private int count; is an int
    private Student representative; is a Student
    private Server host; is a Server
    
13: private boolean alive; is named alive
    private Person tutor; is named tutor
    private Game game; is named game
    
14: Student, Server, Person, Game

15: yes it matters as any other order leads to an error which states that there is a missing identifier. This message is due
to the change in the order.

16: yes, without the semicolon there is an error

18: it belongs to the Student class

19: public is a visibility parameter, Book is a class, String title is a class, double price is the variable

20: I think that the book might have fields such as pages and paragraphs allowing you to write information in it.
We do not know for sure what the names will be.

21: public Pet(String petsName)
{
 Name= Max
}

22: Public Date("March",23,1861)

23: The difference is the method name

24: "The tickets cost..."

25: No it will not need to be changed because their names mean the same thing. This tells me that the name does not always need
to be the same and it will still work so long as it has the same meaning.

27: The error is that there is not a statement

28: printTicket uses a system while getPrice uses a return statement.

29: They do not have a return system due to the fact that there is nothing to return and there would be no use for it.

31: public class score
    {
    /**
    * Increase score by the given number of points.
    */
    public void increaseScore(int points)
    {
        // TODO: Increase score by the value in points.
    }

32: Yes, it is a mutator and you can demonstrate it by adding credits

33:/**
    * Reduce price by the given amount.
    */
    public void discount(int amount)
    {
    // TODO: Subtract amount from price.

    price= balance-discount;
    }
     
    
34: public void currentAge(int amount)
    {
    currentAge = amount;
    } 

35:private boolean alive;
   {
   status = alive;
   }

36: The price is 0 and not what I set it to.

37: My cat has green eyes.
