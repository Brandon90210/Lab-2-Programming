the start of lab 2:)

2: It returns to 0

3: There are no refunds, it still prints a ticket even if i do not insert enough money

5: Yes it is different as the price is changed to 50 cents which is what i set it to.

6: I think the outer wrappers of the student and labclass classes would be similar to the ticketmachine class as you would need
to enroll students in a class similar to how you need to pay for a ticket. You can also print the class list similar to how
it is possible to print receipts using the ticketmachine. Overall I believe that the layout is similar.

7: Yes it does matter, the screen color changes from green to white and the error is that there is no longer a class. The message
I get is "class required" I believe it does not clearly explain the error as the mistake is the order of the "public class".

8: yes it is possible as there is no error

9: no it is not possible as it deletes the class and there multiple errors

10: Fields: "public class TicketMachine"

    Constructors: public TicketMachine(int cost)
    {
        price = cost;
        balance = 0;
        total = 0;
    }
    
    Methods:  public int getPrice()
    {
        return price;
    }

    public int getBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }

11: Constructors do not have a return feature and constructors have empty brackets

12: private int count; is an int
    private Student representative; is a Student
    private Server host; is a Server
    
13: private boolean alive; is named alive
    private Person tutor; is named tutor
    private Game game; is named game
    
14: Student, Server, Person, Game

15: yes it matters as any other order leads to an error which states that there is a missing identifier. This message is due
to the change in the order.
